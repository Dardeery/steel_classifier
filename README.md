# steel defects classifier
This Task to build a classifier that better detect the failure type in production output based on different features. 

## data Source: 
Classical supervised machine learning problem of 6622 samples and 6 different feature columns where the 'defect_type' is  the target column, in other words, the 'defect_type' defines which particular class that a particular sample belongs to. The 'dataset' column defines if  a sample belongs to the training set or the test set.

## data analysis: 
1. use this data to train a classifier. 
2. check autocorrelation in the model,as it has been suspected that there is a correlation between training and test data. 
3. create a visualization dashboard (Report) with the goal of understanding, exploring and analyzing the data using appropriate diagrams, charts and indicators.


Additionally, the analysis includes:
    - process of thought, i.e., how did you come to your solution?
    - properties of the artificially generated data set
    - strengths of the used method: why does it produce a reasonable result?
    - weaknesses of the used method: when would the method produce inaccurate results?
    - choice of the design language and its influences in the reports.
